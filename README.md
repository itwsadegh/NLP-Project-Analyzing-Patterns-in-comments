# NLP-Project-Analyzing-Patterns-in-comments
By Using a dataset of 1.4 million comments from 20,000 users, the focus is on gender prediction and content
categorization. The project involves four key components: Data preprocessing and EDA, supervised learning for
gender classification, unsupervised learning for comment clustering, and a deep learning-based approach.

The following describes the overall structure of our project deliveries:

1.A comprehensive report in PDF format listing all the tasks that were completed.
2. Part 1 and Part 2, two independent ipynb files. We have Part 1 connected to the first three ML portions and Part 2
related to the final section of the project, which is the NN, because we, the group members, worked in parallel.


3. You can entirely regard the Merged.ipynb file as our entire delivered file because we used an external Python library
to concatenate the two aforementioned files. However, in the event that there are any discrepancies, please refer to the separate files that were provided.
